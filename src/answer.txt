How should I start??? It's hard for me to describe this 'emotion/sensation/feeling' or whatever it is, anyway I'll do my best. For a very long time, I've had this strange feeling inside me and it's not easy to portray. It's been there since I was very, very young and instead of disappear, it keeps growing inside me (especially after I've had an episode of depression or lots of personal problems). I feel like something's missing or I'm incomplete. There's something that I need, but I can't find. I used to believe it was part of my depression. If I'm happy or excited about something, the same feeling appears again and drags me down. It's like a ghost. If I had to associate this with something, it'd be with hollowness...although I wish I knew what it is and how to get rid of it. I just needed to write this. It's alright if no one wants to reply, because it's a very abstract issue...at least, you took your time to read it. Thank you

You say you feel like you won't be able to manage working in the future. Did you mean that you're doing fine in your job right now, but you're affraid that you can't handle your job in the future? Did you mean that you're affraid that you can't handle the combination of job, children, and marrage? Or did you mean that you already feel overwelmed by your job which also causes you to worry about the future? Do you feel like other people expect you to have children and marry? Do you feel pressured to do those things for any other reasons? Do you know for yourself (you don't have to explain) what causes your tiredness? 
[S]
I too have this deep void and I think it's because of my depression. My depression manifests itself as anhedonia rather than melancholy. Of course with anhedonia comes apathy and thus a lack of drive for life. With no drive for life I don't have a a goal, I'm just 'living' day by day eating, showering, exercising, and sleeping. Crystal, I too can't imagine myself in the future

The feeling of emptiness described here is familiar to me. It seems to be most intense after being highly engaged with an activity or connected with a group of people, and after all the excitement is over there is sometimes a temporary sense of loss. It seems to be part of a cycle of engagement/disengagement where I connect with some direction and feel a temporary and specific sense of purpose in it, but eventually the loss of a specific sense of purpose can be uncomfortable. My initial tendency when I feel the sense of emptiness is to want a specific direction to engage in, but this would lead to an oscillating pattern that became increasingly uncomfortable when I eventually felt no longer compelled to engage in any of the directions that used to excite me. The feeling of emptiness is useful to me now as an indicator that temporarily it is okay to disengage. It feels like breathing out after breathing in. As I learn to go with this energy instead of opposing it, this flow of engaging and disengaging is becoming more natural. The sense of emptiness is becoming less intense and activities that had all lost meaning seem to be gaining there vibrance again as I allow myself to temporarily stop seeking engagement. Intentionally disengaging can feel painful at first because my mind sometimes craves something tangible that will bring about a specific sense of meaning. It is helpful for me to allow this craving feeling to occur and just let it be what it is until the craving subsides on its own.


[P]
Ok..here it goes.. Some things have been eating me up and well, not sharing them with anyone and bottling them up is kind of gestating. So, I guess I'm gonna share it with whoever reads this. There's this girl I met in freshman year and we became really good friends. In fact so good that we shared everything from out past, present and future, literally talking day in day out in every way possible. It wasn't long that it became kind of an addiction. At least for me it seemed this way and felt kind of same from her side too. A year passed by and suddenly one day she entirely ceased any form of contact. She wouldn't speak, wouldn't even reason for her strange behavior all of a sudden. So obviously I started to think of something I may have said or done to upset her to such a great extent. Almost another year passed by, I started acting casual around her and we started talking again, but like with any other friend. After almost 6 months or so, in a conversation one thing led to another and she herself explained the reason of her previous behaviour. The strange part is it was a really really lame reason she gave which felt half explained/made up and what not, although it revealed nothing happend because of something I did. All I knew was I wasn't satisfied with the reason for all I'd suffered. It was devastating and one of the most worst experiences of my life I can never possibly forget. We still don't talk much but everything looks normal and fine on the outside. On the inside, I can never ever forget how she worse she made me feel. With time, initially I kind of developed dark, remorseful, revengeful feelings towards her which are fading away real slow, not that I don't care about her, but I certainly don't want to show it anymore. I really hope this fades away at a much faster rate when I complete my degree one month from now.
[S]
It could be possible she suffered from clinical depression and couldn't bring herself to explain the situation. That would make sense as to why she wouldn't give a reason nor speak at all. Regardless, the only thing you can do is move on and forget about her. But that's easier said than done. Meditation can greatly help keep the negative emotions under control. Exercise is also important. I think simply keeping occupied or busy all the time can help you to forget about her and erase the negative emotions you're thinking about. Especially if you find something you're really passionate about, you'll be thinking about it more and more until you completely forget about her.
[S]
Ya I'm actually trying my hands on meditation for various reasons. Kinda helps. Trying to keep myself busy too. Thanks though.
[S]
I think the time will help. Try to concentrate what you are doing and try not to think about this.


[P]
I'm not an angry person but when I'm angry I feel as if it's a taboo emotion (at least towards persons. I feel as it's 'ok' to be angry at situations) and I don't know how to process it. I had times when I punched the boxing ball vigourisly and that was relieving, but only temporarity. I don't like it when people scream at me so I don't see that as a solution. Also, thinking bad thoughts about the person(s) is temporarily satisfiying but only feeds the anger in time. I like the concept of assertiveness: to express feelings towards someone in a kind way. But what if you think is to hurtful to say in kind words or what if you don't want to see the person again? (lost friendship). How to process anger in the absence of the object of your anger? And in case I do want to see the person again (my sister), is it possible to improve the relationship without talking about what annoys me about her?
[S]
The way I've dealt with this is by ignoring the thing that makes me angry towards someone. Expressing your anger towards the person will most likely end up hurting the friendship so I try to simply ignore it and accept that it's part of them, especially if it's a family member. Another thing that would be very helpful is meditation. Anything that helps you relax and better able to control your mind would be helpful in reducing the anger. I find drinking black tea to be helpful in relaxing me.
[S]
Depends, if you're extremely upset in that moment and your emotions are controlling you in that moment, don't say it. Nevertheless, if you've already thought about the possibility of letting this person go, you should express the fact that you don't want to see the person anymore. Your well-being should be your priority #1 and if you think these decisions make your life better, do it. You won't regret it. Bury these thoughts in the past. Find new activities to distract yourself. Exercise does help a lot. You seem to be very young. While you're thinking about negative things and feeding your anger, others are enjoying their lives and maybe they're not even thinking about the pain that they might've caused you in the past. Think about it. No, you need to talk about these things, because they'll haunt you and will cause you discomfort. Communication is the basis of a good relationship. Sometimes, when I'm extremely angry (because it's happened to me) I write. I start writting and writting the first things that come to my mind and let myself go (in some ocassions, my mind has gone totally blank and I can't remember very well after that). Nevertheless, that helps me a lot to release my anger. You should try it....
[S]
I also found this website with techniques to overcome anger. I really like the tips that they give here (I'll apply them as well when I feel angry). It's short and accurate.... http://www.howtocontrolanger.net/release...ructively/


[P]
First off, I apologize if you find any typos here. I was really upset a couple of hours ago and I feel I can't think clearly right now. I've had depression for a very long time, but I feel like the symptoms are getting worse. I'm smoking more than usual and my sleep is not as good as it used to be. I wake up every morning feeling exhausted and drained... Literally, I've been feeling like crap these days. As you already know, I go to this university and I'm studying a profitable career (because my beloved daddy forced me to. I tried to tell him that I didn't like accountings, but he told me to eat s%$/ and do what he said because it was the best for everyone -- especially me). In 2010, I even left my studies to get a job and do something that I could enjoy, but it didn't work, because I couldn't find a good job (I don't remember if I already talked about this before, but it's OK). I'm almost done with my career, but this has caused me a lot of stress. There's something that I have not mentioned here yet, but I'll do it: I'm obssesed with my weight and image and, well, I think I might have an eating disorder. I try not to eat a lot and I get really angry when someone mentions something about that. Why am I telling you this??? because I don't know you in real life and you don't know my family and there's no way for you to tell them this. However, if you did, they wouldn't do anything to help me. They'll forget about it... Lately, I've had some ideas related to death. I'm not going to kill myself, because I'm not brave enough to do so, but despite I haven't tried to (literally) commit suicide, I've thought about it...plenty of times...but these ideas are more frequent now. I'm not expecting any word from you, guys. I simply wanted to get these things out of my chest, because...well, they're burdening me. I simply wish someone could just kill me and end it all, because I don't have the fucking strenght to do so. I'm a coward...
[S]
I'm so sorry to hear that all of this has happened to you Crystal. It's really unfair when people hold high expectations for you that you have a hard time reaching. It can put such an unbearable amount of pressure on a person. In my experience, you won't be able to change your parents behavior unless they choose change themselves, but from what you've written, I'd assume you've already tried speaking with them about how you feel. As for your weight and image problem, try surrounding yourself with good friends that will say good things about you. You really don't notice it at first, but once you start hanging around with good, confident friends that have strong morals, you'll notice a difference in your thoughts. I used to be really worried about how I looked myself. Once I met my boyfriend though, things really changed. He's a wonderful guy that showers me with compliments every day, and, despite the fact that I'm still a little self-consious about my appearance, my confidence has improved a great deal. Dealing with depression is one of the hardest struggles there is. I know because I'm right there with you. I've only joined the site recently, so I'm only going off of what's written here, but just try taking 5 minutes a day to go over all the positive things (no negative ones!) in your life and focus on them. See if that helps you to improve your emotional state any. I hope this helps, and if not, shoot me a PM. After all, ears are meant for listening, and sometimes a good long talk can help relieve some of the stress.
[S]
It does sound like your depression is worsening. Have you seen your psychiatrist lately? It would be better to discuss these issues with your psychiatrist since they are trained to deal with these kinds of issues. In the meantime, you can change your lifestyle a bit and see if that helps. I'm talking about things like: Exercising, even if it's just a walk Meditating Making sure you don't rely on junk food to cheer you up. Many people like to consume very sweet or very fatty food, which gives them a spike in happiness followed by a big plumet. It often leaves you feeling worse than you were before you ate the food. I'm not saying don't eat them, but don't self-medicate with them. It's a recipe for disaster. Going out with friends I understand you just wanted to get it off your chest and that's very good. In fact, you should always get things off your chest, whether it's talking to a close friend, your psychiatrist, or even on this forum. It's important that you not bottle up your emotions.
[S]
My depression that ended about 10 years ago was a growing sense of futility about the future. I dreamed of having lots of money and a perfect relationship, but in practice it took all the energy I had just to stay still and I felt myself slowly running out of motivation. It was increasingly apparent to me that my approach to life was not working well. The bright possibilities I hoped to achieve one day slowly dimmed I was unable to achieve them in practice and became increasingly frustrated at my inability to attain the life I wish I had.I repeatedly attempted to find new and better ways to achieve my dreams and sometimes had temporary success but in time I would always find myself in the same familiar place of struggling and getting nowhere. A permanent sense of relief occurred when I finally accepted that I am unable to achieve the life I thought I needed in order to be happy. The moment I gave up I accepted where I was, not in a spiritual sense so much as a recognition that exactly where I am now is all I have left. As I allowed myself to be here, I saw that this moment was far more then a chance to get somewhere else. There was something alive about it, something alive about how I feel and what I think and what everything around me means to me. All of it was alive and moving. With this recognition the illusion of being stuck vanished. Life is and always has been living itself fully and dynamically in many ways at all moments, but it can appear to be blocked when it is seen as a means to get somewhere else.


[P]
It's fair to say I suffer social anxiety but a bigger problem for me now is health anxiety. Does anyone else suffer this?
[S]
What do you mean by this? Are you constantly worried about your heatlh?
[S]
Why'd you worry so much about your health? I know we're all afraid of becoming unhealthy, but it's not a constant thought. What type of thoughts do you have when you think about it?
[S]
You could probably deal with this by taking substances that increase the feeling of well-being. One of them is green tea. Have you tried drinking green tea regularly? I'd say a cup or two everday would suffice for increasing well-being.


[P]
I can't seem to enjoy anything. Nothing makes me excited and what used to be fun is now no longer fun. Music, tv shows, games, movies, socializing, nothing is fun anymore. I feel as though this south park episode describes exactly what I'm going through.
[S]
When I feel highly engaged in what I am doing, I can temporarily feel immersed in some activity or entertainment. Mental stimulation is my favorite drug. It comes with a sense of significance as richly meaningful events unfold all around me. But I can't stay mentally stimulated forever, and when the mental stimulation ends I may experience stimulation withdrawal. I can find myself craving any form of mental stimulation, but like a drug that has worn its use, temporarily I cannot achieve it and in place I will feel intense boredom. It helps me to see this pattern which has occurred for me more times than I can count. We are taught to seek interesting things, to captivate our attention. And when our attention is fully captivated and we are completely mesmerized by something, we are taught to value this as the way life ought to be. But when the excitement is gone, right underneath it there is often a sense of urgency and compulsiveness. It is the need to stay continuously enchanted and the fear of disenchantment. The disenchantment phenomenon tells me that I do not care at a deeper level about what I am experiencing on the surface. If I could force myself to care, I would. But this is outside my jurisdiction. What matters to me isn't really up to me to choose, but it is my responsibility to find it. No one can ever tell another person what deeply matters to another. We can't even tell ourselves what deeply matters to us. But we can find it. We are given a clue when something that we want to enjoy becomes meaningless. This can be depressing when we feel it is futile to find something we actually care about, but when we do find what we deeply care about we then have the possibility of aligning the surface of our lives with the depth of who we are. We then experience the same sense of being highly engaged, but this sense reaches even deeper. It is even more full. Now we are mentally engaged in a direction that has deeper meaning to us and it feels much more enjoyable and delightful as we are able to bring more of ourselves into whichever direction we choose. Life often feels like an onion to me, and for a while a path may fulfill me, but in time the superficial layer wears off and I am left feeling directionless. I am forced to reach deeper and as I find something that matters to me at a deeper level I can feel engaged again, but even that direction might wear off one day as well. The journey of life leads me to knowing myself at deeper and deeper levels with the result of feeling more deeply fulfilled then I ever thought possible. But I also get to experience the emptiness when my activities don't really reflect my values. I can only fool myself for so long. It has helped me to let go of what no longer engages me rather than trying to bring it back to life. When I was little I used to enjoy playing with all sorts of toys that are meaningless to me now, and if I were to attempt to keep myself entertained by them, in time it would all become frustratingly meaningless anyway.  This isn't a problem, it's a blessing. I can't stay stuck when something within me wants so much to grow and experience bringing the depth of who I am all the way up to the surface.
[S]
Nice post. But, for me the problem isn't that I can't enjoy one or two things, it's that absolutely everything gives me no joy. It's like my brain's pleasure center isn't working. Exercise is supposed to be rewarding, but I feel nothing from it. Fast food and junk food is supposed to taste good and make you crave it, but it doesn't taste good at all and in fact most junk food, especially those with high sugar, are disgusting for me. Once in a blue moon I'll be able to enjoy certains things again but it'll only last for a day. I have no idea why. I've been feeling this way for more than 4 years now.
[S]
I have suffered from anhedonia for 2 years and i can definetely say that like major depression, it is very difficult to treat anhedonia on your own and often it is impossible to do. Since in most cases anhedonia is a symptom of some other disease, and it is necessary to treat the disease itself. Anhedonia will disappear throughout the treatment. However, there are a number of tips dealing with anhedonia which helped me: The correct day regime – good night’s sleep, regular meals, and physical exercises; The diet should consist of several sources of serotonin – chocolate, fresh fruit; Focus on pleasant and positive moments, try to do everything on your own in order to make a moment positive and pleasant; Psychotherapeutic correction such as Gestalt therapy, behavioral techniques, psychoanalysis; Pharmacological correction – doctors may prescribe antidepressants.


[P]
Do you work out? If so, what motivates you keep going? I starting working out a few years ago because I was tired all the time, my pant size was getting bigger, and I felt really self conscious. That motivated me to get in better shape and maintain it.
[S]
Yeah, I currently only run because I can't afford a gym membership, but I used to lift weights. I actually have a couple of reasons for working out: 1) Habit - Whenever I start doing something consistently for a long period of time, it just sticks with me. For example, I never think about brushing my teeth at night, I just do it, like my body is in autopilot. The same goes for exercising. My body just tells me it's time to get some exercise. 2) The challenge - Nothing feels better than being able to beat your personal record. You may start off being able to run for only 10 minutes or being able to lift only 20 kg of weights, but as you stick to it you will find yourself constantly beating your previous records. I'm pretty sure I have more reasons, but I can't think of them right now
[S]
There came a specific time in my life, when I really needed a new way around. It all started at Christmas this year. There has been lots of changes in my life, new way of thinking and what I wanted was to get more out of life. First principle was to simply start doing more. Charity, new major, meeting new people. And also new me. I started to work out every day, for about an hour. And it was amazing. I felt better and, what was especially significant for me, was that I had more control of my own body. And as it was, it made me even more enthustiastic person than I was. For now I stopped my training, but I still maintain good eating habits. I always eat regularly and even though I don't work out, I don't gain weight. So it was an important aspect of my new life. And I'm planning to take up a sport again
[S]
When I work out because it keeps me from thinking about other stuff. Also, I usually work out with my friends, so it is kind of getaway for me from all the stress I get from work and life.


[P]
I keep procrastinating about everything in my life, from school to going to the gym, to even making food. Every time I procrastinate I just end up feeling bad afterwards, but I can't get myself to just do the things I'm supposed to be doing. It's like a never ending cycle. Has anyone beat their procrastination problems and if so, how did you do it?
[S]
I really haven't been able to beat procrastination, Emotion. Especially when it comes to working out. However, I try to think about the consequences of not doing what I have to do on time and then, I feel I must do it, no matter what. I've tried to think about the roots of procrastination and maybe they're related to depression, sadness and lack of motivation. I might be wrong, though. But once you've found out what makes you procrastinate, you can beat it more easily.
[S]
Yeah, you're absolutely right about that last point. I found out the reason I was procrastinating from making food is because I'm not confident in my cooking skills. I only know how to make basic foods, like chicken. I guess the more I learn and practice cooking the less likely I'll procrastinate making food.
[S]
For me, try to make a daily or weekly todo list. By doing that I was thinking more about what I should do more often which made me to work a lot more than before.


[P]
I do exercises specially yoga exercise to relieve the stress and depression in my day to day life, and it help me a lot to control the stress, and depression. Yoga is an ideal exercise to get rid of stress, depression, and anxiety. It is mostly recommended by the health experts to control the stress, depression, and anxiety.
[S]
Hey, it is really good that you do exercises regularly to stay fit and healthy. Yoga is really beneficial in stress and depression. 
[S]
Yes it is definetely true, i like doing yoga becouse it really calms me down. And in general in order to cope with anxiety and depression- it may be strange but- we have to have a healthy lifestyle . for example bad sleep has harmful effects. This not only affects our physical health, lack of sleep can contribute to anxiety and stress. Sometimes there is a vicious circle, as anxiety often leads to sleep disturbance. When you are anxious, try to sleep from seven to nine hours a day and see how a few of these nights will affect your level of anxiety.
[S]
We also must eat properly. Anxiety affects the body: your appetite may be changed or there will be a need for certain foods. To provide the necessary support to the body, try to eat more foods that contain substances such as B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as useful complex carbohydrates from whole grains. Studies have linked the presence of B vitamins in the diet of people with a good mental health, and omega-3 fatty acids help reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Complex carbohydrates help regulate the levels of serotonin, “feel-good hormones” that helps us to remain calm. Although we love to suggest otherwise, but studies show that eating sweets and processed foods (with simple carbohydrates) can increase the symptoms of anxiety.


[P]
I'm not sure where else to post this, but my appetite is definitely lacking. I can feel hungry, but I can't feel the urge to eat or anticipation of eating. My body is fine, it can tell my brain I'm hungry, but my brain doesn't care and doesn't give me the feeling or desire to eat. Eating becomes a chore and depresses me. The only thing that seems to help is intense exercise, but its effect is temporary, less than an hour, it just seems to make me want to eat food rather than desire it if that makes sense.
[S]
This is familiar to me as well. Sometimes I feel the physical sensations of hunger and do not feel compelled to eat. The sense of hunger increases for some time and eventually decreases even though I haven't eaten. Being hungry often helps me to reconnect with what is most important to me. When I am hungry and I don't want to eat it is usually because I am living a pattern that is becoming increasingly meaningless to me and at some level I am ready to change but I don't know how. The slight discomfort of hunger helps me to keep in mind this willingness to experience a more deeply meaningful life, and a sustained will to connect with life in a more purposeful way eventually results in a new perspective. Historically speaking the concept of intentional fasting has been found in many cultures all over the world for thousands of years. I believe there is value in dropping familiar patterns as a catalyst in helping us to discover what is most important to us.
[S]
The lack of appetite definitely comes from the fact that you're depressed, emotion. If you're not hungry, you shouldn't eat or, insted of that, try to eat something like a fruit, a smoothie or something healthy. Intense exercise makes you feel better because it releases a lot of chemicals in your brain. Neverthless, if you become underweight, you should see a doctor.
[S]
Whenever this happens to me, I just try not to be bothered about this that much. But try to find out what I really want to eat. And eating those food I really desire helps me a lot to overcome this.

[P]
Okay met this women on a bdsm dating site. Started talking and bonded on mental health. I'm bordline and recently very self sufficient and overcoming well. She has d.i.d , social anxiety , and personality disorder not otherise specified. That's great I love the understanding. What's really irking me is the repeat victim playing. And sob stories. When we had our first meet she started the conversation by saying she was baby sat by hells Angels. Which didn't bug or scare me. I figured she's letting me know she's afraid to get hurt and has been hurt and it was a sort of defence to past abuse. But as we continue talking and meeting it just keeps getting layed on thicker. She has multiple abusive ex's , her mother hates her , she just ran into a childhood abuser , her dad abused her. But by the way she says all this it just doesn't seem real. I've been in this position before with the last women I had a thing for and that situation turned out bad to worse to good to terrible. A little background on her she lives at home , on the same provincial program I am . She is sweet girl. But I don't know could I be carrying past abuse and past experiences into talking with her and have my guard up as well? Shes coming over tomorrow for a dinner and movie date at my place. What do you guys think?
[S]
Maybe see how the next few dates go. You can't really know what someone is like from one meeting.
[S]
Trust your instincts and see how it goes!
[S]
You cannot judge person before even meeting him or her. So, I would say just be pacient and meet that person as many times as you like and decide!


[P]
dont feel visible at the moment to people feel that nobody wants to know, feel that i dont have hardly anyone, feel that friendships upset me and relationships upset me.. prob cos im insecure and sometimes the other person has issues which also impact the friendship.. currenlty feelin not good enouhg. and abandoned in general in life.. not meaning everyone.. just feeling kind of forgotten at the moment i know i shouldnt always take things personally but when people dont pay u any attention or dont try to make bit of effort, when they used to for example it does kind of leave me feeling upset.. especially when people make u feel wanted at first or for a while, or even when u form friendship with someone and u think u connect to them and then they abandon u or confuse u, i dont know i sometimes just feel like my feelings dont matter and sometimes find this hard to not let it affect my emotions ect.. i know it would be healthier if i tried not to let these things impact me.. but im currently feeling extreely lonely with this.. working through chronic trauma and having therapy and am very very lonely and isolated as it is.. also have problems getting out aswell at the moment and its really getting me down , i dont know i sometimes think yeah someone wants me but then later down the road either because of there actions or lack of i feel that oh im invisible, i just feel like im a lonely island at the moment and its makin me feel very sad and depressed, especially as what im dealing with and have been for years is extremely hard for me..i dont have anyone else to turn to other than my sister and it feels so hard sometimes. Does anyone else really struggle with friendships? i know that people say well the other persons actions is to do with them, but when i get attached to someone i can get real hurt if they abandon me or make me confused when i cared so much, or even if like say i make a new friend online i still sometimes end up getting these thoughts and feelings eventually that they are going off me, (dont know whether that is true or not)
[S]
I just wanted to send you lots of love and hugs

I find watching other peoples lifes stories about how they deal with life's difficulty also very helpful

Oh you feel lonely, I suggest you try to talk more with your family. They are definitely the people who care about you the most!


[P]
Since my recent bout of anxiety and depression I have "realised" the cruel reality of humanity and how the nature of people is horrid. The main questions that often pop into my head when thinking about this are; 1. Why do good (I use the term "good" loosely) people become "bad" 2. Why are people deceitful 3. Why do people hide their true colours 4. Why do people help others when it suits them, and only to benefit themselves or to free themselves from guilt/make themselves look good. My realisation has severely damaged my trust in others, I have let go of many people who I was good friends with mainly because I have realised who they truly are. I have yet to find Friends who are genuine and I worry that in this generation being a "snake" has become commonplace. Question 4 was raised after my suicide attempt, only a few of my so called friends actually came to my aid and even fewer are continuing to support me everyday. I know it sounds selfish but does it really take that much out of someone's day to send a little message to someone? Does anybody share this idea or am I just delusional because of my mental illness?
[S]
Sadly, I think you've hit pretty close to the mark with a lot of that. Human nature is flawed at the deepest level. It always has been - not just in this generation. People are so often two-faced, putting on a good impression while serving self underneath. Christianity ought to be the answer to this, but even as a Christian I see it all too often in me - being completely self-absorbed to the point that I'm not there for others who need help. I'd like to blame it on bipolar but that seems like the easy way off the hook! Then too depression darkens our view of the world around us. It takes the worst things, which are true, and blows them out of proportion. I make an effort to always think the best of others, and make excuses for them if they fail. It doesn't change the fact that what they did was wrong and it hurts, but it does help me be more compassionate to realize that they may be going through a lot themselves. We can only do what we can do.

I largely agree with you, and would add that this is “learned behaviour” which for most people only pops up once they hit teenage years. The impulse to do good seems for a lot of people to get eroded by contact with desire and materialism and ideas of status. But it is also about who you choose to connect with. Buddhist people seem to have a better handle on this than many non-humanist atheists. The company you keep does very much influence when and where you make progress, and if you end up finding a spiritual side to yourself. You have the option to go looking for a better, more real type of person who is more grounded in compassion and generosity of spirit. The thing that I often do is keep in mind the fact that everyone suffers, and many people are so caught up in their own cycle of Worry-Anxiety-Fear that they don’t leave room in their thoughts for loving-kindness and empathy. Society, with its focus on greed, desire and materialistic things, does its best to beat these things out of people. I don’t think it is “human nature” per se. I think a lot of this is learned, from what people see around them. Given better examples, people can be better, more forgiving, more compassionate, more spiritual.
[S]
You're somewhat right, people are decietful and most of the times unworthy of trust. We are flawed and we do bad things intentionally or unintentionally. But how will you survive if you only see the worst in people? It's really difficult to live like that. You can try to see the good in people and ignore the bad to the extent that it doesn't cause you or anyone else any harm. I've read this somewhere, "the world is full of good people. If you can't find one, then be one." This is what I would suggest you. If you fail to see the good in the world, be the good yourself.

I was dating a guy for 2 years and he cheated on me and I took 2 years off from dating and tried to completely heal myself before jumping into another relationship, well finally I start dating my current boyfriend (we will call him Steve) Steve and I have been seriously dating for 4 months. We live together (a little soon I know) but things just felt so right and like we had known each other forever. Well about 2 months in for no good reason I started to get SUPER paranoid about him and wondering what he was doing and who he was texting. I would go through his phone regularly and he knew it, and I wouldn't find anything. Yet I kept accusing him? One day I had this weird feeling and went through his things and realized he had been messaging this girl that lived states away, (sexting I should say) I broke up with him obviously, but he begged for me and swore to me it was nothing and that he was so sorry and that to him it was basically like interactive porn because he knew he'd never actually meet up with this girl & they were just sending pictures b&f (Yes we both watch porn together so porn doesn't bother me) and I know that is some bullshit excuse and to some it would be a deal breaker but for some reason it may be because I love him & it wasn't physical, I decided to forgive him and stay with him. We decided that we don't wanna have each other's passwords and work on trusting each other because I didn't trust him long before he did that. I mean the way I see it, if he's gonna cheat it will come to light somehow right? So a few weeks have gone by and I keep telling myself I forgive him and I do want to be with him but I'm TERRIFIED that he is still doing these things. Mind you we live together so I know he's not sleeping around and we go to the gym together and we are around each other all of the time but it's the phone. Anytime his phone lights up i get an anxious feeling, I wonder what he's doing. I don't know if it's me but it seems like he keeps it even closer to him than before. I could just be paranoid but like I said we don't have each other's passwords anymore and I don't want him to think I'm insecure because I promised I would work on trusting him but how do I shake this feeling? I want it To go away so bad because a part of me does believe he won't do anything again bc he saw how bad it hurt me and I really want to try and make this relationship work because he is a very sweet guy and when we are around each other it's perfect, but sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me and I have all of these negative thoughts in my head. Does anyone have advice on how to curb the paranoia and how to rebuild trust in a relationship that was once broken? I know people say if there's no trust then it needs to end but I know there HAS to be a way to rebuild it. HELP
[S]
Dating is for learning who another is and getting to know them. I think you want it to be okay with you while really it isn't.
[S]
Give it time. We aren't machines. We need time to process things.
[S]
As far as building trust, time, communication, and honesty will help you. Don't try and hide your feelings from your boyfriend. Talk to him if you want things to work out.


[P]
Something that has been troubling me greatly recently is the fact I don't feel any positive emotions towards anyone, as in I don't feel love or affection to even my family members (besides one person but it's kind of awkward). What I once felt with my dearest friends is just replaced with fear, I don't know how to talk to these people anymore. Even the ones who help me and remind me of how much they love don't spark any reaction from me. Don't think I have a complete lack of emotion, I get excited, I get amused, I laugh but not with people, only with my cats (well only one of them because his brother is a little devil) and any other pets in my extended family. When I do things on my own like watch movies and play video games I exhibit positivity as well. I don't know what I can do to sort this or if anyone else feels/has felt like this and I'm worried it's going to progress to a point where I really am alone because I've shut everyone out.
[S]
Hey. I just wanted to send my love. Don't really know how to help as i have BPD and am all emotions. Just wanted to let you know i am thinking of you though. Much love
[S]
Are you on any medication that might be causing you to feel like this? I didn't go through exactly what you're going through, but Seroquel used to make me feel very numb. I still feel numb in a way, but so far I've been doing slightly better. I know you said you're not feeling completely numb. Maybe it's the mental illness?
[S]
I have noticed that I lack emotional responce often. It could potentially be mood disorder related. I have schizoaffective-bipolar so some of my symptoms are psychotic in nature while others are mood related. I can't say as any medication fixes this I think it just makes me not care anymore. I feel some connection to some people (a lot of them on here TBH) but its sort of diluted if thatmakes sense. The only med I've ever taken that made me feel all warm and fuzzy and truely HAPPY (like true innocent childhood happiness) was tranxene. Unfortunately I cant get a hold of it. Some others on the forum have had HORRID experiences with it. Idk what I'm trying to say, I guess just to tell you I can relate.


[P]
10 years ago last Sunday my girlfriend left me. And I've been nowhere near having another one since. I hate it. How can it be TEN YEARS. TEN YEARS!!!! It's horrendous. I feel like doing something crazy. But what would that achieve?
[S]
God knows why she left you-i think you are awesome. Don't give up hope in finding another girlfriend. Someone will come along I am sure. You deserve someone wonderful.
[S]
Well I've never had a girlfriend or a boyfriend, so...
[S]
Hope you will find a woman that will adore you. We all deserve to be loved and have someone that make life worth living for. And being alone is the hardest part for those who are more of a family person then someone who is workoholic. 


[P]
My mom has been sick for a while. She thinks she has cancer but the doctors cannot find anything they havent scanned her lungs yet.. Because of the pain she's desperate so she got into a treatment in a house with other patients...everyone says shes depressed badly but her and i think it's because of the pain she's suffering it's so awful. This is the second day and it's a living hell for her she's can't manage and still is in pain. My life has become a living nightmare right now knowing she is suffering i barely eat anymore i can't do anything else it's destroying me. It's so bad i can't tell my aunts or they will break down. Does anyone have or had a similar expierence with their parents being so sick i could talk to? I'm going through a living hell right now.
[S]
I am so very sorry that you are going through this with your mom. Firstly the doctors will need to do tests to rule in or rule out things so that then they know what they need to treat and therefore the treatment is more relevant.
[S]
I am sorry to hear that your mom is sick. I just wanted to send my love. Please take care of yourself too!
[S]
Really sorry that your mom is in massive pain today. The thing is when you are highly stressed you loose the ability to cope. I took time to get into some habits that helped to relax me.


[P]
I have never been in a relationship. As in with a girlfriend; is that weird? I wouldn't say ive been avoiding relationships, ive just never sought one out. I guess what it mainly comes down to is not wanting to complicate things (life can be hard enough just trying to cover your own groceries and bills); and also not wanting to be a burden on somebody else on the occasions that im terrible to myself (stressed out over work; binge drinking; moodiness, etc) and then probably feeling terrible because of what you put them through.
[S]
I don't think it's weird, I'm in a similar position. For me there were a few different reasons but I just never ended up with many girlfriends or opportunities to live together with someone.
[S]
Depends how you define weird. Unusual, yes. But not a bad thing at all!
[S]
I guess it comes down to age and whether you want it or not... Being a forty year old virgin would be a bit weird... I guess its how much you want it that would make you weird.. I mean look what it did to Elliot Rodger and he was only 22


[P]
How do I get closer to people. So I've just finished my freshers week at university and I met some really nice people so far. I am by no means comfortable and although I only live about an hour away from home, I feel so terribly homesick. I think without meaning to be, i've become quite insular and as a result, girls I know from halls have started hanging out together without me. Since seeing their insta stories of them grabbing lunch together and going out clubbing I had a few cries (I know) but have since made an effort to be more bubbly and social. I had breakfast and lunch with one of them today and it was really nice, but I still worry she won't invite me into their little group to hang out. I am super lucky in that my boyfriend of 3 years is in the same uni and halls as me, so we do quite a lot together! We have a nice group from halls so far but the majority are guys and the 1 girl who is involved also (who I hung out with today) has her own girl clique so i'm often just hanging out with guys which makes me feel like such a scrape. I know its only a week in, and i'm not expecting to have a group of amazing girlfriends already, but I just feel like everyone else is coping so much better than me whereas I'm analysing my every move to make sure I don't act stupid and I can't stand when I'm alone in my room with no plans and no one to talk to. I had a gap year last year and worked throughout so didn't have any work friends around my age (which I preferred) and it was so much more straight forward. I miss my gap year and my old pace of life, I feel like uni is so superficial and fickle and I just want it all to be over. Is there any advice on how I can get myself out there and not feel so lonely/ combat the homesickness? All advice is appreciated!!
[S]
Can you join some societies and get out there? When I was at uni it was easier to make friends in my course year group. We had a good bunch of buddies there. I found making friends at halls more difficult. Don't lose your head and keep focussed. 
[S]
Have joined some societies which should help meet some more likeminded people, but sadly the nature of my halls isnt very social. I'm catered and now most people sit in cliques during breakfast and dinner so I always make sure I eat with someone I know so I am not alone!
[S]
Keep in the real world is what i would strongly encourage you to do now and through life. You wont find happiness and connection in cyber space.


[P]
No one cares. I just need someone to actually give a shit about me...Is that selfish? Is that wrong? Is that normal? I don't feel I have anyone who really cares about me and I really need that at the moment. I live for my daughter and yes I know she cares but it's different....a child's care is not the same...I am her carer not the other way around. I am an adult in need of another adult to care. I have intrusive crazy thoughts at the moment and I have only just realised they evolve around getting someone to show me they care even if it's just their job and just for a moment. These thoughts would get me into dangerous situations if I was to act on them......which with no immediate parental responsibility this week coming could easily become reality. I am angry with my Dad at the moment for leaving me as he was the only one who really cared. I wish someone real just took the time to listen to me, help me sort through a few things, was there for me, actually cared. I have no one that seriously asks....how are u? No one that seriously gives a shit and I am so embarrassed to admit all this, feel pretty pathetic. So Alone
[S]
I'm sorry you feel lonely,I don't have much to say except I know I don't know you but I do care. Have you ever tried counselling? It might help. Could you join some groups and make some friends maybe?
[S]
I would find it hard to believe that no one gives a shit about you. You sound very down at the moment, understandably, but these thoughts are common when down. Loneliness is common though, and when down and lonely it's a nasty mix
[S]
First, I am sorry that you are lonely... But at least you don't annoy people. Sometimes I can be annoying. Cheer up!!

[P]
I absolutely disgust myself. I truly am the most fucking ugly, fat, disgusting thing you have ever laid eyes on. Thank you, Seroquel, for taking me such an ugly fatty. I hate looking at photos of myself because I look so horrible. I absolutely have got to lose weight.
[S]
You are beautiful on the inside. I'm willing to bet you are just as beautiful on the outside. Love you!
[S]
Do not frustrated by the appearance. That is not everything. You seem like a lovely person to me. Very kind.
[S]
If you feel fat, don't stress out, but maybe you can try to find some sports group you can join! Go have fun and lose weight at the same time.


[P]
I’ve always been a normal eater (far as calorie intake). My problem has always been exercising. I can do it for hours. Not keeping still but in constant motion. Not sure what that’s called. But I’ve messed my knees and back up. Making it impossible for me to run, anymore. I ran a lot for over 15 years. Sitting here now, I’m thinking about how much time I can get in later this afternoon.
[S]
I wouild highly recommend, that a) you see your GP about your knees and back, and also, seek physio therapy, or physical therapy, for you, and eventually with the phsyio, or physical therapy help, you'll return to more normal.
[S]
Could I make a suggestion? Instead of doing high kicks, and side kicks at a higher impact level, alternatively just do the moves on a lower impact basis, meaning keeping one foot down on the ground at all times, and also no jumpier movements at a lower impact level when doing the moves. Instead of running, just march on the spot, just a few samples, I thought might be of help to you.
[S]
Over exercising is not a problem I think. Do not get too much stress from it but try to spend your time watching movie or play game instead. I think the key thing is you don't get stress from over exercising. If you can't fix that, try to find a counsellor.


[P]
Eating has become such a chore and a game of restriction. I have had a bad ED for a few years, severe yoyo dieting. Now every time I eat I'm literally never satisfied. Eating is just a tease for me so I try to eat as fast as I can because eating slowly makes it worse. After a two week binge eating 'normally' does not even come close to satiation but I have no choice unless I want to gain weight. I've tried everything under the sky, eating healthier, eating filling foods and even allowing myself to binge every once in awhile but nothing helps. I've pretty much learned to deal with feeling hungry to borderline starved all the damn time but it really gets to me sometimes. I wish I could just eat like a normal person, eat a normal amount and be filled for x amount of hours and I've tried so hard to train myself but nothing is helping. Its so frustrating. One thing that really flusters me is constantly seeing other people enjoy food, hearing people chew and seeing food all the time in my house. My mom leaves delicious snacks out everywhere so that doesn't help at all either.
[S]
Are you physically hungry or is it a mental thing? It can be hard to tell. Have you seen a doc to see if you have a physical issue going on?
[S]
You might need professional help. I think a dietitian might be able to help. You might not be getting satisfaction because something might be different with your taste buds.
[S]
Anxiety about eating can be problematic. I suggest you try to see a doctor and ask some questions. 


[P]
I am literally eating myself to death and Im so scared. Ive got OCD and depression and I think binge eating the way I am is a kind of self harm because I hate myself so much. Ive put on about 5 stone in a very short space of time and I dont seem to be able to stop eating. I'll start dieting or eating better on a Monday or something and the next day I'll be in the supermarket buying tons of junk. Ive been doing some research and I think I have an eating disorder and its gotten to the point now where if I dont do something its going to kill me but I dont know where to turn. My mum knows I eat a lot but when I mentioned it may be an eating disorder she dismissed it and said I should 'just stop eating so much'. I dont feel I can go to my doctor either because I think he'll just laugh at me the same way as when I tried to get help for my OCD. Its taking all of my willpower at the moment just to stop me going back to cutting myself. I just dont know what to do anymore.
[S]
I really feel for you, and it sounds like you are in a very difficult situation indeed and the people around you really don't understand. Do you see a therapist and are you on meds? The meds of course can have an effect on your appetite/weight.....but really it sounds like the bingeing is very much to do with your emotions. If your Dr doesn't take you seriously, why not change and see someone else? It's important you feel listened to and eating disorders of any kind, including Binge Eating Disorder which is a recognised condition can be addressed if you find the right support. I have periods of binge eating too, but when i'm depressed i go the other way and lose my appetite like i have at the moment and i'm terrified of it returning cos i know i'll end up bingeing again. It's that feeling of having no control, it's just awful. It's great that you've managed not to cut yourself, that too is something i used to do, and the more out of control you feel your life and food is the more you think about cutting, but at the same time you know that it won't help you to feel better, it won't curb your appetite and it's just a very temporary relief.....so well done for resisting the urge. I hope you manage to find some help for yourself, it is out there, but you're gonna have to ask for it. You deserve to feel better about yourself and eating is not the answer.....although sadly that isn't enough to stop the habit.
[S]
I totally understand I have been dieting and binging for years. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and have put on a stone I feel terrible fat ugly and worth less. It is really difficult to figure out what to do. But I just wanted to tell you you are not the only one who is experiencing this. Let's overcome it together.
[S]
I totally feel for you, and its more than just 'willpower', if you hate yourself totally then its about the relationship between yourself and the reason why you eat. Your not alone this is the place for you, and i totally understand how you feel about going to the doctors i had a bad experience with the doctors - and i feel like i dont want to talk to them either.


[P]
I've had an eating disorder for over 5 years. It's gotten to a point where everyone around me who knows about it has had enough. They just expect me to get over it, like its a broken arm. I try, but its not that easy. I dont know how much longer i can live like this, if you can even call it living. How does everyone else cope?
[S]
Sorry to hear that they are not supportive about your eating disorder. Have you had therapy or what have you tried to recover from the ED?
[S]
I'm sorry to hear that you're suffering. It's never easy dealing with an eating problem. I struggle with binge eating, and I find that exercising and keeping myself as busy as possible really helps. I wish you all the best.
[S]
Hey. I wish I had a solution. I also struggle. I try to think of each day as a whole new chance to have a binge free day. That way if I mess up and succumb to my bulimia, I can have another go at succeeding tomorrow.


[P]
I'm very well, managed to gain decent quality of deep sleep overnighter, waking up very late though, at 9am. Which in turn causes me to feel irriitble slightly. No main major symptons coming up, so all is well. Once again, i'm very well, no hearing voices, no paranoia, no anxiety, nothing very severe, and nothing very acute. I'm still taking my daily doses, of 25ml. I thouight I would start a brand new thread, seeing at times, I am very well, without too many mental health seirous issues, coming up. And for Recovery combined, to include fitness, self help management, and voluntary work.
[S]
I like what you post. You take care of yourself really well
[S]
I am also happy that you are feeling good! I wish more people will have better feeling everyday. Have a great day!!
[S]
I am glad you are feeling well. And I really hope you will feel like it for the future as well. Let's all have a great year.


[P]
I don't even know where to start.. I'm diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and I am currently on many medications including mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety medication. I have a spinal condition Scheuermanns Disease which puts me in pain a lot of the time so I also taking tramadol and other pain killers.. Life is so shit. Like what's even the point? Nothing good ever happens in life and when it does it never lasts. It's just full of suffering. When you get older you get more health conditions and your life slowly deteriorates so what even is the point of going through the life cycle in the first place? If I end this now then I won't endure the suffering. There isn't a solution medically yet for many things and I just don't think it's worth fighting against everything..
[S]
Sorry you are feeling so bad. You have a lot to deal with medically. Can you distract in any way from how you are feeling?.Sometimes it can be a case of just trying to get through each day, each hour, each minute sometimes.
[S]
I am really sorry that you are having depression and anxiety. But I just wanted to tell you that everyone experience some level of anxiety and depression. So I hope you can cheer up and find something joyable!
[S]
It's terrible that you are feeling depression. But you will be fine. I am sure you have great people around you. Try to spend some time with the people who care about you like your family!


[P]
Today is my birthday. I am 61 years old. I was trying to think of something fun to do for my birthday. The art museums have terrible exhibits right now. It's too hot to go for a walk on the fishing pier. It's too hot to go for a picnic at the park. It's terribly strange to be 61. 
[S]
Happy Birthday. Hope you have a nice day.
[S]
Many Returns for your Birthday, have a nice time what ever you might decide to do eventually.
[S]
Happy Birthday!! I hope you have the best day today.


[P]
I am so tired of my husband's jerk father. He treats my mother in law like a house maid, she is aging very quickly lately and he still finds time to go fishing every weekeend. He keeps all his feelings to himself. When my son visits he either ignores my son or tries to control him with overwhelming rules. My husband has changed careers, which his father protested, and we have been doing much better, but still there is that cold north shoulder of a man who parented him for 16 years and is now or maybe always has been a mystery. My husband looks up to him and tries to treat him like a loving father. Yet, he expects no consideration from him in return. My father in law has worked in personel for hundreds of years. I guess he is successful. Is that what it takes to work in this society? You pour out all your emotions to your coworkers so that your family life suffers so much that people wish you were dead! He also treats the son who is 28 and still lives at home much better than the rest of us. Why does he act like this?
[S]
Have you talked to your husband about this? If not, you should. It's not going to change your father-in-law, but it may relieve a little tension in your marriage. This sounds a bit like my mom's relationship with my dad's parents. She has never been completely excepted in their home. It has proved to be very hurtful to her during the 30 years they have been married, but at the same time, there's really nothing she can do about it. (not only that, at Christmas time she would give my cousins the most wonderful gifts, and my brother and I got pencils for school.) My dad knows her feelings, and all he can really do is stick up for her. That is why you should tell your husband. He needs to stand up for you, if necessary. You could talk to your father-in-law until you're blue in the face, but I honestly don't think it will do any good. Your husband, on the other hand, may do some good. At least get him to treat your son like a human. 
[S]
My father is now 73 almost 74 he passed his life working ( im young 20 I cant understand how ur husband feel tho) and its like i never did something right, well its a feeling, cause deep in his heart he must regret his pass and what he did but since hes now too old to change he continues to be the old man without emotions and careing. I know he loves me I know he cares about me so I care about him. Never wished bad things to others that is my advice, everyone has his own time. Your time will come, I promise. Take care
[S]
Sorry to hear that you hate your father in law. But my advice never make an enemy. I know it would be hard to do that, but trust me you don't wanna go there. Try to talk with your husband if you think it is more than you can handle.


[P]
Okay well, i need to talk about my problems and get some perspective. It really all started maybe 2.5 years ago. I was in my last year of school, and the stress of university was getting to me. I was having ahard time sleeping. I was always so tired and so zapped for energy. After school i thought my insomnia would end, but it continued. I am a really good job, and alot of responsibility, but my mind is always so clouded. I take sleeping medication every night, and it is destroying my memory. It got pretty bad laster year, i tired to take my own life, but without success. This has just totally destroyed my quality of life. I have been thinking about qutting my job and taking a year off to recouperate, but without my job I really do not have anything. I just do not know what to do, I want to live and recover but I fear I may never. I just need some advice and a friendly ear. I feel so alone. If i can recover from then I could live out my dreams. I just wish and pray this will pass. I am at my breaking point again.
[S]
I'm not a doctor but you sure sound depressed. You didn't mention in your post whether you are under a doctors care. Three years ago I took 9 weeks off on a paid leave of absense due to stress/depression/suicidal tendencies, and while initially the break was good, eventually the monotony got to me and I started to sleep around the clock. Taking time off didn't ease my depression, it made it worse. But what works for one doesn't necessarily work for another. Do you have a good relationship with your employers? Would they be supportive if you were able to tell them how you feel? Do you have family or a significant other who are able to also support you? You need compassion and reassurance, and it's good to see you reaching out here, but try to do the same out in the real world, too. I believe that a problem shared is a problem cut in half. Don't give up on life. Do what you need to do to make things more manageable and just take it a day at a time. I hope this helped some. Hang in there and God Bless.
[S]
If you can afford it, take time out. Travel. I was in your situation, stressed out by office job, not sleeping, depressed. So, I grit my teeth, saved for a year, and quit the job to travel for a while. You can travel very cheaply in SE Asia and meet tons of travellers, or do casual work somewhere like Australia, if you can get the visa. 
[S]
Your well being is a scale-upon which you need to balance physical health, mental health, and emotional health. When emotions are running low, bulk up on the other stuff to get you by, and visca versa. It will change your life. 


[P]
I am so alone I want to kill myself I need help please.
[S]
you are not alone. There are many people who want to help you and who have been or are in the same situation as you are. What has happened for you to be so upset? You are more than welcome to private message me or email me anytime. I would be glad to help you through your struggle.
[S]
whatever your troubles are, remember that each one of us are suffering in our own way. We all have our baggage of troubles, just to different degrees. I am going through a tremendous amount of pain, sadness and disappointment in my life right now. True, the thought of suicide did cross my mind, but I realised that that is not going to solve anything. God placed me here for a reason, and I believe that I have not completed his work as yet. Love yourself and look at your own positive aspects. Try to feel compassion and loving kindness for yourself. Perform more kind deeds if you can. When we help people, we are really helping ourselves. It opens our minds and hearts. Please, be strong.
[S]
Yes it is hard to be alone but if you give up now then you'll be passing up the wonderful experiences you will go through when you are with someone. Life in general i aslo very beautiful. There are so many things out there for you to see. Please be a little patient and don't hurt yourself. You are not alone everybody here is there for you.


[P]
Hello, I am 15 years old, Im from Cali, and I need some help. Me and my boyfriend of 11 moths broke up about 3 months ago, he no longer loves me and doesnt care about me any more. He is a total jerk and blows me off constantly. I love him with all my heart, but thats not the reason I'm writing. ever since then, my perfect life has been crashing down. My grades have slipped, I am no longer happy, I cant do the things I used to love. All the gusy I have met have been total jerks, and I am extremly lonely. I feel so hurt that he could move onw ith out me, and I am the one that is suffering. Please help me!!
[S]
I'm one particularly lonely person too and i've been surfing through the net to ease my boredom then i come accross what you wrote. First thing I want you to remember is that "it's his loss that he lose you! not yours!" Life is about making choice and once yu made the choice to move on, you will. Don't make him succeed in making your life more miserable than he already has. I hope you give some time and love to yourself, cause you most deserved it. Goodluck.
[S]
You will feel better eventually. I have heard that it takes roughly the same amount of time you were with someone to get over them completely! I know you probably have heard this before, but your only 15. You also have tons of other stuff going on within your life and your body that is new. Give it time...you dont need to have a replacement! Good luck!
[S]
First, I want to tell you that you are YOUNG. Everyone feels lonely at some point, but you will be ok at the end. Everyone suffers time to time and it will make you stronger. So, good luck and I hope you will be ok soon.


[P]
I cannot say my life is bad. I really want to just write out a lot and see what anyone can make of what has been going on. I feel lonely a lot. I have friends but the closest ones live an hour away. My best friend visits every other weekend. That is all good cause normally when she is around I feel better. I am not close with my family and never will be. My best friends mum is more like one to me. I have a lot of down time at home. I have recently started redoing the room so I like to be in it more. I just have too many emotions, and I am alone with them. A few years ago I was in a true state of depression. For 3 months nothing but crying and sleeplessness and for no reason. Slowly that ended with the return of school. I read somewhere though that if you have been depressed and never got treatment (I chose to not get help) that you have a higher chance of becoming depressed. I feel that I will never be fully depressed again because I fear it so much. I feel like I want someone again. I miss having a boyfriend and miss someone caring about me. A few months ago my first love/first really serious relationship ended. After a year and 3 months I was alone again. Took me a while to overcome but now I am. I have had one boyfriend since then but broke up with him after a month because I did not want to be with him. I took my best friends advice and stayed single for a while because it had been so long since I was. It has been about 2 months. Last week I met a wonderful guy. Exactly what I am looking for. It seemed we clicked. After 3 days we already kissed and it didn't feel wrong in the slightest. Problem was that he is leaving for college, and lives an hour away when he is home. Though he, like me, had a serious relationship and I gave him advice on if he should try again with her. I said yes because I believe in second chances. If you didnt try again then you would wonder forever. I never really thought anything would happen between us, and its not that I am wanting him. Its just I feel so hopeless because I cant find that guy I am looking for. I feel like I missed out because one so close just passed by. It just isnt great to feel such unhappiness with life. Its like being on the edge of depression but knowing you wont go over.
[S]
With every door that closes, another opens. Don't think of it as: "you missed out", just think of it as: "there ARE good people out there for me". Take it as a sign of things going well for you. Many times people meet at a time in their lives where things just can't work out, and they're forced to let go. It's definitely sad, but these people move on to bigger and better things. It's just the way things go, so don't get down on yourself, you're not alone. Never regret a good time, and look back at it with a smile!
[S]
You may indeed be suffering from a mild form of depression, and yes without treatment it can continue to haunt you for years. I think however from what I am reading... that you don't know how to be happy just being by yourself. This is one of the most difficult things for people to do. Truly knowing how to be "alone" and enjoying it. To love spending time with yourself is the greatest gift you can give. Not only to you, but for a future mate. For me I spent years working on this, getting comfy with who I am, and taking the time I have for just me...to do the things I love...I can now do so many more things!! I never feel alone...I can pick myself up and go to a movie, dinner or anything without thinking twice about it. Filing your life with others is nice, but others cannot always be there. People move, relationships end. When it's all said and done what are you left with? YOU...so best to really like yourself.
[S]
My best advice to you is, get a hobby, get a puppy, get a plant, get something else. make yourself happy, make yourself someone you love, then give your love away.


[P]
i am so lost now i cannot believe it. i am sitting here right now thinking to myself that i have to go to pwork tomorrow- which means that i have to get up at five- im tired but i cannot sleep- and i really mean that i cannot sleep- i try and try so hard to fall asleep. you see the problem i have right now is the world. i am so unhappy with my life in general that it is making me miss the beauty that i know is in this world- in fact it is like the concept of this world being beautiful is as odd as the concept of me walking on the moon tomorrow! i just graduated from highschool- got set with art school- so i should be happy- i mean- i live alone and i work- so i have money- i should be partying- but i cannot for some reason. everything looks dirty and messed up- i cannot be around people for too long and everything makes me so angry. i have this vision in my head of a nice appartment with a kitty and laying back relaxed with the thought going through my head that i am happy. i should have someone that i can love who loves me too- but no luck- every - although beautiful has crushed me with- "lets have fun- no romance!" whats that about???- i thought guys were usually like that???!!! im not being mean but every i have dated or wanted to grow in love with says they just wanna have fun- am i a bit nuts???? but thats not all. everytime i work i think that this will be it- ill finally have it good now. i mean i worked so hard to graduate- but it got me no where. every job i get isnt enough. my parents help me with little more than nothing - i mean i was in a foster home for years cause they were nuts (i love em' even so) and as soon as i ask them for a bit of help- they freak out and tell me im an and throw nothing but a few bucks! i mean i a 18- i understand that i am an now- but you think they could help a bit- maybe just to make up for all the missed years of having to deal with me or my brothers and sisters. i work hard- i get nothing. my friends are a small amount- mainly cause i cannot connect with most people cause most people i meet are nuts (not in a good way)- and have some strange ideas about and - and i cannot relax with that. so anyway- my friends are all i have- that and art- and yet i get the idea that they would disappear in a moment if something nice came their way. i would never move away form my best friend- at least not at a moment when we have so much to build- i dunno- maybe i have a weird idea of what friendship is. now i decided to not go to art school- at least for now- and work- take a few classes- then try to get some of my work in a gallery. but it is so hard to paint when you are exhausted after working all day and wait an hour for the bus- go home to a little bit of food- all i wanna do id sleep- but ill drop anything for my friends- which drives me nuts- i mean if we go out we go to the mall- THE MALL! i mean i like the mall- not every other day though. i would like to go to a gallery or a book shop- out for tea at a cafe- which we rarly do- and those ideas get a look sometimes- but i have no guts to say- "whats the point???!!!" i wasting my time but i cannot think of anyway to spend it. i have a sense of andventure- somewhat of a transcendalist- and i wan t to believe that there is something more meaning full to life than this- or that this life now i live is the icing to somnething with more meaning than can be imagined. but i find a sick feeling. i wanted to go to NYC and try it there- so when the chance came up- i jumped at it- a guy i meant and grew to trust said hed take me up there and id love it- this a long story in itself- but to keep it short- he took advantage of me- and i feel so dirty for letting this guy trick me into stuff for the idea of a better life. it seems that i am stuck in a situation- im starting to lose my ground- i want something that is worth living for- a person- friend- whatever. there is nothing- art even- as passionate as i was- seems worthless at times. the only thing i can hold onto with art is the idea that the moment spend creating a painting will last forever. but i am starting to think that there are not enough of those moments, nobody wants to talk about purpose- they shove it to the side and talk about something stupid in my opinion- like the guitarists in rancid or something goofy. music is music- clothes are clothes- there is too much image- just another thing that i cannot stand. even now- just to talk i have turned to the computer- and i have to realize that every connection i mke on the computer will always beon the computer- just like in life- when people are only friends at certain times. i am getting depressed. i need something soon. i dont want to fall into a hole. i dont think there is much advice to give that i have not thought of in a manner- i just wanna talk about whats me inside- and maybe some of you will understand me.
[S]
I am very sorry to hear that you are unhappy with how your life is going. It seems to me like no one understands you. I sometimes feel the way you do and when I feel depressed as you do I keep my head up high and tell myself that things can only get better. Cheer up.
[S]
Sound like you feel very unloved. Maybe your parents didn't make you feel that way. I don't know the answer but if i ever find it i'll let you know. Stay single if you can, you may end up fodder for users else, which will make you feel much worse. good luck.
[S]
Me too...I get angry so often and i just hate my life without a reason. I'm young and i just shouldn't have anything to worry about but i just do. I agree with Goincrazy...pets are the most lovely thing in the world. Whenever i get angry, i "play" with my punching bag, makes me feel so much better.


[P]
So I just recently viewed this movie on the Peta website. I think I knew that animals lived in such horrible conditions on farms but the mind does go to the deepest level. So now I have become a vegan. I still feel so hopless, I feel so sad and broken because there is nothing I can do to save these animals. It is really breaking my heart and I don't know how to move beyond anger and pain. There is so much I want to do to help but when I begin to think about it, it becomes too much. Instead I become someone who is useless. I am feeling so overwhelmed by all the saddness that goes on in the world. I feel a bit scared because I always saw the beauty but now the anger is only letting me see the bad. I feel lost and confused. I just don't know what to do.
[S]
I found your post very interesting. I realize there are a lot of animals out there that are treated very badly and it is extremly painful to know that. Veal for example is sickening in my opinion. You have to realize not all animals are treated poorly, and many farmers love their animals.
[S]
Make a protest. Speak out, it is a free country. Get some of those animals. Save them. Remember, you can't save them all, but for now it doesn't seem like your saving any. And to know when you get those animals and you see them all the time, knowing that they will be o.k. Whatever goes around, comes around. and when people kill those harmless animals, they will get a bad thing done to them.
[S]
First, you are very emotional in a good way. I believe you are good at sensing other's feeling. And that can be one of your strongest point. I hope you can use that ability for others. 


[P]
Lately when friends, family etc dont email me or call me back right away I get highly frustrated and upset. I dont know how to deal with this. I am pissing myself off lately and dont like the person I am becoming. Any idea how to overcome this?
[S]
Just try to be calm about things. Do relaxing activitys. It sounds like you just feeling like when you call or send something you want to know what's going on. You can practice trying to relax yourself by doing yoga, meditation, or something of the sort. Hope my advice helped.
[S]
DONT WAIT FOR REPLYS !!! Never wait for something. Its like wating for a girl to call you, so you sit next to the phone and look at it !!! Never do that. You will get too much fustrated...... Its a waist of time. If you need to receive a call from some one that is really important , AND you know he is going to call ! So here you can wait. But other wise if you "think" tha girl will call you or your friend will sent you an e-mail , dont waist your time. Becasue my best friend sends me an e-mail one a month, AND he have PLENTY to tell but....... dont wait!!
[S]
I find responding to other's requests for help comforting and that replaces the anxiety in waiting for replies to emails. So maybe try go to emotional forum and see other's post and make some comments.


[P]
well it's about my best female friend, she also is my ex... i don't know... i care for her as a friend.. well that's what i thought... me her and my best male friend hang out almost everyday, me and him are her best male friends... you understand? well, she has a crush on this 18 year old, and she's 15... and it doesn't bother me A LOT, but a little bit, since, he's 18...and she's only 15... and tomorrow her and him are meeting up... and since i know that, i've got this strange feeling in my stomach.... and maybe i still love her... and i don't know what to do, if i'd go and tell her, i'd make an ass out of myself, and if she has a crush on this 18 year old dude, then it would be of no use, and i'd make and ass out of me for nothing...
[S]
If I were you, I would stand down. I think it is natural for you to feel this way, and if you approach her now about it.....your timing would suck, and it means less to get emotions out of people based off of jealousy. If you do love her, wait for a better time when these emotions are not inspiring you. Just my opinion.
[S]
Try to stand down and try to calm down. I think that is the best you can do and try to talk with the person. I wish I can give you more clear answer, but there is no answer for these kind of question. You find out yourself.
[S]
I can see why your jealous about her going out and you obviously still have feelings for her. There is not much you can do but, wait it out. Maybe you will have an oportunity to tell her later. I'll tell you this much relationships between 15 and 18 year olds never last that long. Usually a few years at most because she will mature over time and he will want to settle down seriously eventually and probably want a girl closer to his age if he becomes more mature. Not always the case but a lot of times it is. Just be a supportive friend and grin it out. Everyone needs a good friend.


[P]
Well, been a long time "Reader" first time poster. I've been using computers all my life as an escape from the real world. It's to the point where its all I do. I quit school because of it, I don't ever even go out anymore. I'm a hermit. I want to get out into the world again and make use of my life... GED's will be available soon and I'll get one of those.... what should I do meanwhile to help face the world head on with my depression? I take anti depressants, but.... I used the computer to further get away frm depression... now I want to get out of my severe addiction to the computer... what would you guys suggest?
[S]
I think it will be very hard to get your way out of that on your own and I really think you should ask someone for help. If you are taking meds I guess you do counselling already, if not, start it now. Or you could call the local youth help hotline which should be in the yellow pages. For a start, you could also look for an activity, maybe at a sports center or a painting group or whatever where you go to on a regular basis at least one hour a week. Hope that helped a little.
[S]
Don't be afraid to write things off, if you hit a bump along the way, learn from it and keep going towards your goal. Set your attention only on things that deserve or require it. It not let it be and move elsewhere. If you pour your energy into things that don't appreciated it you will become drained. So know when to let it go. This transition won't happen overnight, but its shouldn't take a long time only lots of effort. Good luck I hope all of this made sense and that it is relative to your personal situation.
[S]
There is no simple answer for this. But I've suffered from some of the symptoms you described. Try to walk around while you listening to your favorite music. That can help you for sure.


[P]
I can't stop thinking about one thing that happened to me a month ago regarding a chance i didn't take a little further..now i will never see him again.. just to share wiht you all.. REGRET SUCKS and this is a realization i have come to right now.. any way to get over it?? Its the worst emotion i've experienced yet and its consuming my life.
[S]
We have all made mistakes at one time or another, missed opportunities, slip ups, etc. The best we can do is learn from these, Its so easy to fall into the trap of re-living your past differently, what if I did this, or that, What if, what if over and over. What you really need to consider now is, What If your missing out on many good things worrying over something in the past, What if tomorrow you will regret, having wasted precious time regreting something in the past. Dont make the same mistake twice, sieze THIS moment now before it also slips away and becomes another regret.
[S]
The only advice I can give you is, try not to see it as a regret, try to see it as something which has made you stronger, something that you have learnt from. Hopefully what you've learnt is that life is short, and you should take every great opportunity!!
[S]
Regrets are one of the worst things that many of us has felt, what could have been if I only did this or that. It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel. Don't be afraid to tell that person you truly care for them because things change in life and in the end they just might be the one you were to be with.


[P]
I am so lonely. I miss my ex b/f who was also my biggest crush ever, i truly loved him. I kno everyone wil say....u can tfind love until ur happy with urself. Well i want a bf so bad, i want someone to hold and someone i can cry to. My friends are friends, i want someome who i can love. I dont kno where to look for it, do i go to the mall, the store, what? I dont want ne one from skool cuz they are all immature and i dont like most of them. The ones i do like are taken, or dont kno im alive. My new crush lives two and a half hours away and he likes some other grl and always talks about her to me. She lives very far away tho so i could have a chance, but i dont want a weekend relationship thing. IM a junior in high school and i have never had a boyfriend. You cant possibly understnad what its liek to be lonely day after day. I really need someone. Im not a big partier, but lately i wanna drink so much to just forget. I smoked weed once and i want to do that again to. I think its all because im just feeling lonely. I would real;ly ask everyone not to tell me its ok to be single, or that i have to wait for that special one. i want smeone now. Like in the very near future. please help me in any way u can. PLEASE.
[S]
Four words for you "Let love find you". If you go searching for love your going to find heartache, and trouble. But if you let love find you it will survive. Your young, you have your whole life ahead of you to find true love. Focus on your studies. And no matter what alcohol and smoking or drugs won't solve your problems or help you hide from them. Because your problems will still be there when you sober or come off the high. Be patient, when its your time it will happen.
[S]
Firstly, it is OK to be single !! I'm single, and I am enjoying it to the Max! In saying that, I would love a girlfriend right now - but I'm not too pushed about it. I was, a few months ago, and that hurt me bad - I was hunting like mad, and was clinging to the concept of love again. What I mean is that your full on need for love is pre-occupying your mind far too much - with all this emotion, how can you really find a good partner? The logistics of the relationship with the new crush are awkward, but as you said - you don't want a weekend relationship and that is probably what it will be. What else do you not want in a relationship anyway? You should be thinking about what you want in a relationship instead of trying to find any possible one you can to get into just to find "love" again. The answer is not in a bottle or a joint, but they can help get the attention off the situation which is what you really are looking for. If you could live without this feeling and emotion right now, would you? If you could be totally content with or without a boyfriend right now, could you live with both? You could, and thats why I want you to question honestly to yourself why you want this so bad?? Hope this helps you some.
[S]
It's hard looking around and seeing your friends and people doing things as couples and feeling left out because you feel there is no boyfriend or girlfriend to do things with after school or on the weekends. I think though that if you would take the time to look into peoples eyes you would see a very common thing among them. The truth is that everyone feels the pains of loneliness from time to time, and not all of these relationships you see are happy relationships. Everyone needs to feel loved you know, and there is really nothing you can do to buy love it's just something that is given. My advice to you is to start a mission to be a joy to other people and to learn to love others. You will find that people will want to be around you more because they will see that you will have a special gift that no one else seems to have... And most importantly be yourself, love yourself, and try to do everything to the best of your ability....


[P]
I was homeschooled last year and the year before last because I couldnt go to school. I was just to depressed and sad, I felt so weak and discusted with myself which of course only made things worse. anyways things got so bad I started seeing a shrink, my mother more so pointed the discussion twords getting back to school than what the problems really were. I didnt really tell her everything that bothered me because I didnt want to tell her that is why i wanted to see a shrink in the first place. anyways, realizing that it was going no were fast I decided that i didnt want to see my phycyatrist anymore. anyways here it is a year later i have been going to school for roughly over a month and its starting to happen agian, missing school starting to feel discusted with myself that I cant suck it up and go to school like the rest of the people even though they hate it just as much. but wait something new has hit the table, my mom thinks that I should be on anti-depressants. im not sure what to think, on the one hand they may very well have the power to help me. on the other hand do I really want to turn to medication so quickly. I guess im afraid it will altar my consiousness as it is now so I wont be able to think about things like I used to. does anyone have any experience with anti-depresives?
[S]
If this is a recurring problem that has been with you for awhile and it doesn't seem to be something that gets brought on by a reaction to some event, then medication might really help you out. I have heard from people who have taken anti-depressants that it really helps a lot. It is a very personal decision and you should definetly talk to a doctor about it. A psychiatrist would be best, because they can help you with the stuff that the meds can't help with. Maybe try seeing a different person if you didn't like your last counselor.
[S]
As for the counseling, don't throw away the whole bushell because you got one bad apple. There are lots of good counselors, psychologists, psychoanalysits and psychiatrists out there. Remember that THEY work for YOU, and YOU pay their paycheck. So if you're not satisfied with one, fire him/her. Also, it's generally a good idea to go alone, so nobody else has a chance to steer the conversation in a particular direction (effectively derailing the counselor's established process of evaluation)...
[S]
I've never told anyone this but I think I am depressive but I just sort of hang in there most of the time, but you should try the anti-depressants because you are young and you have a good chance of getting better for it, it wont hurt will it? Sincerely good luck my friend.


[P]
Hey, I am a college Junior, I have everything going for me career wise... I just don't see the point anymore, I don't feel like going on with life... I have these feelings before, I have seen shrinks, and taken medication. I feel like my life is always going to be like this, and I feel disabled. (like I cant function like a normal person because I am depressed). College itself is stressful, I feel like I am doing all of this work, to end up in a dead end job, stuck in a cubical. All of my money goes toward school, I am dead broke... It sucks because the only jobs available are the min. wage, and the unpaid internships. I cant stand it, I feel like I am always going to feel this way... I guess what I am asking for is some motivation to keep going on...
[S]
Yes, college is really stressful. I remember very clearly being up all night studying and doing project and feeling "what is the point - I'm never going to use this stuff anyway". And well, for a lot of the courses that ended up being true. But for some of them, I certainly do use them on a regular basis. But I do know that without my degree there is no way I would have gone as far as I did. Yes I started out in a cubicle, but I moved up quickly because they saw my potential. Within a few years I got out of the corporate world and started my own consulting company. I had more work than I could handle. In college I found some better jobs off campus that paid more than minimum wage. I don't know if thats an option for you but you might go check it out. I just want to encourage you that it DOES get better. You are sacrificing a lot right now and I totally understand where you are coming from. But it pays off later - trust me!!
[S]
I am in the same boat you are... I'm a junior as well and it just feels like I'm never going to graduate. Especially with this year being the worst I have ever had in college, GPA-wise, and with all that has happened within my life since August, OMG, there have been many days where I have jsut wanted to say, "Forget it! I can't do this! What's the point?". I know how you are feeling. And like you, I spend the afternoons behind a cubicle, answering phones and trying to please other people when I see myself head of my own company in the future having other people doing what I am doing. thereforeeee, with that, what I'm trying to say is... in order for me to get there (future), I have to keep going and strive to do my very best. Great things come to those who wait, just remember that. It may seem like it's the end of the world and that school is dragging you down but press on! Don't be a quitter. Keep an upper lip and just remind yourself that you can do anything you put your mind to! Good luck!
[S]
Sorry to hear your sad. It sometimes seems like everything is against us I know I have some really bad times too but there are positive things as well. I find the best thing to do is try to plan what you want, its important to put it down on paper and also the problems you see to get there. Everybody is different but I find exercise is great even if its just a walk. Also sleep affects me, its kind of odd when I am down i do the things which make everything worse i.e. go out with friend and drink too much which is crazy as it not only spends money which I dont have but also makes me feel down. You need to make sure you are doing things you want to as well and try and get a balance whether that is reading sports catching up with friends etc.. Financially I have spent the last six months without pay while trying to dig my business out of bankruptcy so i understand what you are feeling. At times there doesnt seem to be much point but that is short term. You need to look at longer term goals min wage jobs and internships arent great but what they do give you is experience, without it its difficult to get on. Try to find something which at least gets you in some way on the track to were you want to go. Also I always stick by the fact the more you put into something the better it is, I know that can be easy to say but I look back at my first job. it was really boring and paid little I started with a friend and the difference between me and him was I gave it everything and came out with at some great experience where as my friend is still stuck in the same job. Take care.


[P]
I realize that this site tries to stress that 'you are not alone.' But many times during the day I do feel like I am alone. The thing is, it is so hard to express my feelings because I have had emotional problems since I was a little kid. Some people may have similar feelings as me, but I feel like no one will ever know exactly how I feel. Sometimes I feel like my mother dropped me when I was a baby or something. I feel so out of place and out of touch of people. I am beginning to believe in one of Murphy's laws: if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. Like when I'm sitting down eating with my friends, I say the wrong thing and then one of them mocks me. I realized how boastful I was being. I am beginning to believe that there I am missing some kind of serious element that is involved with having a good time when socializing with anyone. I always tend to stay away from people, and if I do talk to people, I never open up to them. Because everytime, and I mean everytime, I try to open up to people, people just end up not liking me that much. I can tell, like when I was talking to those people when I was eating. As soon as I made a boastful statement, they all made the assumption that I was a goody-two-shoes type person who must always make As in every class (and I usually do). I realize that I am very boastful at times because my good grades and high skill at programming are the only things that I am good for. I like the way I am for the most part, but how is one supposed to like themself if they aren't compatible with other people? What is the point of interacting with other people if you end up being depressed when you try to hang out with them? But then if you don't interact with people, then you probably won't get far in life (like when you get a job, etc.). I am just so frustrated and feel like someone out there is setting this all up (and I know they aren't, but I just feel that way when I am in a bad mood, like right now). They made it so that I will never be able to have fun in life (except when programming). Someone suggested to me earlier that I get new hobbies, etc. But I don't like anything else other than computers and feelings. And I know there are people out there with somewhat similar interests as me, but I have not found one person who is both interested in the same stuff as me and a person who isn't a jerk all the time. On many occasions, I feel like a jerk myself for not being with other people. And I hate this because there is no direction with this post. I am just letting my feelings out and looking for pity. I don't why, but I like it when people pay attention to me (again, I sound boastful). I guess that's why I always strive to make the best grades and learn as much programming as possible during my free time: so that people will recognize me and then maybe later on in life I would get some good friends and maybe even a girlfriend. And yet I have strong feelings that I will never get a woman because of the way I am. It's like I love myself, yet I hate myself in some ways. Again, it's nearly impossible for me to describe the thoughts swirling through my head all of the time. I am just very frustrated and tired of having to always think of ways to avoid social situations when people want to do something with me. Maybe I am meant to just never to open up to people because of the way I am. Stubborness and boastfulness of everything is not allowing me to break out of this emotional era. (I apologize for the long post. I am just being blunt and honest about all of this, and my face turns red and I get very emotional every time I let out my true feelings, and because of that I tend to keep typing.)

You should know that I feel like you do. I work with computer networks and achieved CCIE certification, which makes people say, "This guy better be good." In a way, I'm very alone. I don't mind being alone, because I like who I am, I just don't understand why people don't come to me and be my friend. I have been figuring it out lately. You (and me), we have to make an effort. What we GIVE is what we will GET BACK. So instead of sitting at a table trying to make friends, be a VOLUNTEER for a school (maybe in programming) or a foundation. You see, I always got good grades and expected people to follow me wherever I went. I was always a leader. The fact is, most people are more giving than that and spend their time giving it to others, not worshiping me! I was selfish. Give your time away to someone who needs it and you'll find your place.

Well, I think your problem is a little more serious then a "laugh it off " kind of issue, you sound llike your are going through a small stage of depression. Go out and try to meet someone in your common field, women or men, doesnt matter, just make some buddys. Hey, your first poster seems like a nice person to me, why not start with him? Then you guys can talk and keep in touch and keep each other happy. Sounds like you need a friend who shares your same interests in life.
[S]
A few have posted that your friends should NOT be like you. This is SO TRUE. My best friends aren't anything like me. I think they are my friends because they round me out. Just an FYI.... part of being friends is learning things together and growing together. If a friend wants to teach you how to make pottery, don't shrug it off... give it a shot. I think this is what life is all about. I for one don't think you are depressed. You are just stuck. You are trying to find the answer on your own... that won't work... You know.. even if people laugh at what you say.. that's not a problem.. the problem is that you don't laugh with them! Laugh at yourself and they will like you, believe me.

Have you ever worked so hard that you lost your social life? Did you ever wonder what it's really like to be a physician-in-training? Although I wouldn't describe myself as a workaholic, as a physician-in-training, I've had to study 100 hours a week for months. (It was a requirement- not something about which I had a choice.) That's months without any social interactions. Although now my life is easier (I'm only working 70 hours a week), it's difficult to deal with the loneliness. Have you ever felt really lonely? What did you do to make the loneliness better?
[S]
The best way to deal with the loneliness is when you are out in public, make a point to open a door for something and smile. Go to a book store and have a cup of coffee and just say hello to someone. When I was lonely, I realized that I wasn't alone when I noticed people would look over at me and smile, or talk to me about something. I realized that I was never really alone at all. Being lonely is a state of mine.
[S]
It's hard if work takes all your time. Besides work you just don't have the time or energy to do something to enjoy yourself. Although I never experienced lonelines from a work point of view, I lost a lot friends/contact by moving and so, I can understand how you feel. Lonelines is scary sometimes, well almost all of the times! I found out that friendship with a few good friends will help you through it. It has cost me some time to fiend those friends, especially the ones who accept you for who you are, but I've found a few. And those friends a "cherish"!! I they "cherish" me!! When times get though on me a just call my best friend and talk about it. And the best thing is he does the same with me. Don't rush it, just keep an open mind and look around. Find someone you can thrust and is on the same level in life as you are. Go to a movie sometime, just by yourself. I do that very often, although I have friends enough right now. it's just that I'm free to do the things I want. In this way I meet new people. It has cost me some time to get in touch with "the strangers" I meet at the movies, but in the end sometimes it works and sometimes not. Just give it a try. A other option is INTERNET! reply to a message on this forum. or send a answer by e-mail. Go to MSN and chat with people. If you want, just send a e-mail to me, we can keep in touch every now and then. (just so you'll know, I'm from Holland so you'll have a international contac then). Hope your doing well!!

Although, I never had a feeling of loniless, my mother has it. It is not that is just changable. She had to work very hard on it to loose that feeling. Now, after three years, she can say the feeling of loniness is gone. How she did? Socialised by finding hobbies such as painting, drawning, Tai Chi and so forth. Talking about how she felt and changing her attitude towards it. I can see it hard for you to socialise if you work seventy hours a week! Find someone at work (maybe of another department) that you can take lunch with and combining lunch and socialising. And remember, it is better to have a few very good friends than a lot of acquaintances that you can not talk real life matters with.

Fear – I am afraid of being alone and of being seen to be alone. That is two completely separate things. I get lonely and it would be nice to have a shoulder to cry on, someone to share my troubles and my life with. Someone to love. That may happen who knows I may find some crazy girl? I can deal with that. The other thing, being afraid of being seen to be alone is more complex. Being single is seen somehow as a failing. We seem to be under pressure to be part of a couple, part of a group, anything but alone. We get to a certain age and we are expected to get married and start a family. So many of us feel naked and exposed without a partner, even young teenagers. We have been known to lie about it or worse get married because of it. Where does this pressure come from and why? Why is it wrong to be without a partner? I know for a fact that many of us alter our behaviour rather than stand out from the crowd. Going out for dinner or just going to a movie is so hard on your own and parties are sheer hell. I have friends but sometimes it would be nice to be free to do things alone without feeling like a freak. Peer pressure starts at an early age and God I get tired of it. It never ends, it is remorseless, pitiless. I am tired of being afraid to be myself. I fight it but it grinds me down. Does anyone know what I am talking about?
[S]
It is a cycle. I have been single my entire life and I've felt the pressures and the judgement from the couples, the friends who constantly date and the relatives who "cant seem to understand why my 15 year old cousin can get a guy, but I can't." The same comments Bzborow1 gets. I went on my first date the end of November 2003. I had a great time, it was fun and he is a great friend. And even though I loved the idea of being part of a couple, he wasn't the one I wanted to be a part of. I would rather live my life single then settle for someone I don't feel right with. As for being seen and going places alone, I've grown used to doing things on my own. I started doing things by myself my junior year in high school. I was afraid at first. Afraid of the comments and what people were going to think. And afraid I wouldn't have any fun being alone. But as things went on and I went to more places by myself (target, mervyns, homecoming, prom, etc.) I realized that being able to walk around by yourself and be happy with not having to always have someone by your side is the best thing you can give yourself. I've made more real friends now than I have my entire life because I was seen as independent and different. I didn't have to be with a group of 8 girls when I went to the bathroom, I didn't have to call up all my friends just for a 5 minute trip to target, I didn't mind being alone. I understand that walking around, seeing all the couples and wishing to be a part of that world. That some things need to be shared with the other people in your life, a special guy or girl. And yes, going places with friends is a total blast, but occasionaly you need your alone time, to go out and be completely yourself and comfortable enough with who you are to be seen alone. Also, going places without other people has a lot of advantages: you won't get cancelled on, feel left out, have an awful time hearing about people not having any fun, get things done faster if you're in a hurry, and plans being changed because so and so can't make it at the original time. When I see people walking around alone and they look comfortable and confident while doing it, I see an independent, original person. But of course this is all just my opinion. Just remember that what other people think about what you do or don't do alone is nothing against you, its their own problem. 
[S]
you shouldn't be afraid to do things alone, sometimes it's good to be by yourself and reflect on things in your life. I like to go shopping by myself occasionally, and at times i'll run into people from school and they'll ask me why i'm alone. It's just something i find relaxing...and i don't feel like a freak about it!
[S]
The pressure you feel is only you. I do things alone all of the time, but you have to remember, I don't care what others think. I haven't fallen in love yet, I'm not going to make the mistakes my friends did and marry someone because "it's time". The problem isn't society. The problem is the pressure you are putting on you. Be a leader.

I'm in my early years of being a teenager but my parents just doesn't seem to trust me. They don't let me out with friends and things but I don't really mind. Then next they start ignoring me and go for my brother more. Worse still in my place now its holiday, so I practically have no one to talk to except for my brother who teases me with every word we exchange. I fell like I'm going crazy. Sometimes I feel very depressed. I cry very often and usually I do not know the answer why. I don't know how to ease my pain. When I let my parents know about it, they'll just tell me I'll be alright. They refuse to take me to a psychologist because my mum once worked in a hospital and has some nurses for friends. She's afraid her friends will gossip about me. She is a person who believes that everybody that sees a psycologist has a screw lose. I tried to explain to her but she doesn't want to listen. My school will be reopening soon, so I'll have some friends again. However I don't know why dread it so much. I lost my only bestfriend last year and she's now in another group of friends and not in my class. Those girls who'll be in my class are very proud and self-centered. I just don't know what to do. I'll also have a major exam in 2004. I wonder how I'll cope. My mum is very hot-tempered these days and when she gets mad, I'm the victim. I think she does that because she thinks I'm the weakest in the family. I apologised for not answering other people's problems because I don't think I'm in the right state to decide. Thank you for reading this. Replying would be like a saint. 
[S]
If i can recall what you just wrote, sounds to me like your mother is in denial. It is a mothers job not to avoid her childrens issues but to face them head on. You can show your mother this letter if you would like so she can see from an out side party who doesnt know either of you, what she is doing to her child. A mother is suppose to be the one to protect and nuture the child. Not Neglect and avoid issues. What kind of mother is this? The type who is probably going through something with none other then "YOUR FATHER" I bet money that she's taking her disappointments with her marriage out on you. Your brother is just being a mean brother. Most brothers do this, because they are immature and have no sense, and couldnt wipe there butts if they werent trained! So I wont go so hard on him, however Your mother needs to get her act together before you either leave the house feeling like you need the attention or nuturing from anyone and go out and try to get it to make up of the lack thereof or before you feel like its actually all your fault. You and Your mother need to go to therapy, not just you. ANd it really bothers me that she has the audacity to keep you from it just to save face in the community. I dont' like that one bit. I also doubt that the place she worked at is the "only" clinic where these services are availiable. I think she needs to find another one where no one knows her to go to. Her denial and embarrassment is only going to make things work. And therapy will be more helpful to the both of you. You need a professional there who knows how to get her to listen to you. And you to listen to her. I hope this helps you. 
[S]
ive been goin throught the same kinda problems and i dunno its hard to cpe i once had clinical depression and it to is hard to deal with i dont really kno wwut to say cept u can talk to me bout this stuff anytime it helps to talk anyway hope u feel betta aight well good luck!!!
[S]
I can feel your emotion. But trust me you will miss those times. Those hard feelings will make you stronger and will be good memories. Enjoy life you are still young!

I have become a very angry person since I found out that this girl is back in town. Well this little tramp dated the guy I am with now, and cheated on him with 6 different guys. She also slept with the guy I was dating a long time ago, and then she went around acting like she was my best friend and things like that. Well she moved away out of state, and I found out she is back in town. I just want to find her, and whoop her *beep*. I talked to my bf last night about it, and he said I need to just leave it alone, and forget about it. My bf, and I talked for a long time last night, and I found out he is not very happy. He is not sure what is wrong, but I can tell he is sad. I feel bad, and just wish I could cheer him up. When he is sad it makes me sad, and I know how the story goes. I just don't know what to do anymore. I love him, and I want him to be happy. Do I need to just listen and be there for him as much as I can until he cheers up, and he starts having better luck? I want to help him, but I don't want him to feel smothered by me. Does anyone have any suggestions?
[S]
Carrying that anger with you is not wise. Anger is a baggage, an emotional burden which eats into you slowly. You would not want to spend your days as such, yes? So learn to let go of those thoughts. You can live your life to the fullest without being agitated by the ghost of her. You would have to speak to your boyfriend on what's bothering him. Ask him nicely. Do not be too pushy if he does not want to share. Just let him know that you are there for him, when the time is right, he will speak to you. Hope that I have helped.
[S]
i know what you mean about the whole cheering the bf thing up. you see while me and my ex where going out our best friend died and i was really really not okay but neither was he so i tried to act semi okay and i stayed there with him. well he always told me how thankful he was that i was there with him, but now he says that he really wanted me to leave him alone. i don't know what the truth is... probably he just said that to me because he was mad when he said it. but i would ask your bf what you can do to him. tell him you love him and how much he means to you and let him know that you are there for him. well i hope i helped. oh yeah and about that ho just ignore her. i know that will be hard to do but i have to ignore my ex's ho'esh sister everyday. well i hope i helped you. 
[S]
Your boyfriend is not happy, and you want to make him happy, so for a start i would start listening to him and forget the girl. Secondly i would ask him whats wrong and why. He says he doesnt know, but how can that be possible? It doesn't make sense to me. He should open up to you if not then, then when he feels the time is right. Just be there for him, and show him you love him. Good luck, and smile


[P]
I just found out yesterday that my friend/ex of two years is being shipped out to fight in Iraq. He is in the national guard and im very depressed because of this. He will probably be gone for up to one year or more. Any words of encouragement?
[S]
It's not a GOOD BYE...It's a TILL WE MEET AGAIN, he'll be back soon. All you can do is support and wish him the biggest luck in the world.
[S]
Just keep in your mind the reason he is going over there. I know it's sad, my cousin and one of my friends just came back from Iraq and I still have a few friends over there right now... But Just pray that he comes home safe, which is about the only thing you can do and another important thing is if you guys keep in contact support him as much as you possibly can, cuz the troops that go over there need as much support as they can get. But i'll keep him in my thoughts and I hope he comes home safe.
[S]
I apologize if maybe you meant something else.. But whatever... I'll say again, It doesn't matter what Branch of Military the people who are over there looking to kill Soldiers and mess don't discriminate.. Remember that.


[P]
Im having alot of trouble in my life right now i feel like just another face in the croud i dont feel special i'm not happy with my self PLEASE HELP ME GIVE ME ADVICE OR SOMETHING!!!!!!
[S]
Can you tell us more about what's going on? What is happening that is making you feel this way?
[S]
well i have no friends and im overweight i try to lose the weight but i dont have the willpower my parents don't listen to me and it seems like they like my sister more because she'll do somthing and then blame it on me and she rarely ever gets in trouble
[S]
dude ive been there, especially with the weight issue. i used to weigh 260 pounds but now im 225 and feeling alot better. just find something your interested in; i found football and weight lifting. when you think your life is about to end things can pick up. in grade 11 i hated my life, but things are relatively better now. just keep on trucking...


[P]
I feel so unattractive, I feel as though no one really wants to be in my company. Maybe I am talking to the wrong people here. But I dont know, sometimes I feel just totaly useless and unwanted. Even though I know that my family loves me and all that but sometimes it feels like that just isnt enough. Sounds awful greedy I know but its true. I dont really know what saying it here will do, but there it is.
[S]
Hey i am just like you in a way but all i do to keep my hopes up is to think about the future. i know how it feels to be unwanted and i know what it is like to have someone you loe so much leave you for someone else and that sucks, because feeling like this seems as though it will never go away trust me on this one just think of possitve things and think of some things that want and work on them, this will help.
[S]
maybe you've just focused so much in only one thing.. maybe your life have been a routine so you suddenly feel that worthlessness.. so why not try other things?? things you haven't done yet in your entire life... i think its someone you need.. its something.. 'cuz the truth is noone could ever fill you up 'cus we all have this empty side of us..
[S]
Its not greedy to want to be wanted.I am sure many people love you and want to be in your company.You may just be in a depressing part of life where you think no one wants you.This wil pass and you will see how much you are wanted.


[P]
Hey all, hoping to get some support, feeling some anxieties lately. My husband and I have paid for a test to find out if he is the father of a child from a past relationship that I have known about from the beginning... he didn't cheat on me or anything, it all happened before he met me. We just want to know one way or the other so we can get on with our lives. How do I get a handle on this situation and calm my nerves?
[S]
wow, that's a lot to handle, princess. i think you're right, the results of this test will have a huge impact on your relationship, especially if the child is his. if he is a responsible father, which i'm sure he is, he'll have to have contact with her for the sake of the child. i understand where you're coming from trusting him, but not the chick. i think that what you're feeling is natural. i'm not sure what to tell you at this point other than to try to not think about it until the day actually comes that you will get the test results..there's no use in over worrying yourself right now when you're unsure if there's anything to worry about at all. the best thing you can do for your man, who is probably just as worried/anxious as you are is to be there for him & support him.
[S]
Your gonna have to prepare to fight for yourself. If you think/know this woman still likes your man, then your gonna have to prepare for any of the lies or crap that she is going to be causing you. I think you should let your husband know now that you know this is coming, and that your gonna fight for him, and hope that he will fight for you. Good luck
[S]
This is a really tough situation and I feel for you. There are a lot of sleezy chicks out there, and it's possible (probable) that she wants to find out if your husband is the father just for child support/ something to use to get him back. But you are lucky because you can trust your husband, which is more than a lot of women can say. If you are under a lot of stress and anxiety, imagine what your poor husband must be going through! Yelling or complaining about the woman and the situation won't help; the stress that would create could just drive him away from you. The best things to do is be super-supportive Superwife, offering lots of reassurance, hugs, and backrubs. It will remind him what a good thing he's got! Unfortunately, dispite this woman's sliminess, the child is not at fault here and is an innocent party. If your husband is the father, he really owes it to his child to be a responsible father and visit with the child. It's just what a good person does. So suck it up, help him get through this, and offer lots of support, and you will never have to worry; you'll be the only one he wants to come home to.
